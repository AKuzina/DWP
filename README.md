# DWP for MRI Sematic Segmentation


Pytorch implementation of the paper [Bayesian Generative Models for Knowledge Transfer in MRI Semantic Segmentation Problems](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00844/full)

We use Deep Weight Prior (DWP) [1] to perform knowledge transfer from large source to the smaller target dataset. 
We use a common benchmark - BRATS18 [2] as a target and MS [3] dataset as source dataset. 
The method perform better that randomly initialized and fine-tuned models.
